# RUNSTR GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY
**Complete Tactical Playbook for User Acquisition**

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Owner:** Growth Team

---

## Overview

This document provides actionable tactics for acquiring our first 50,000 users across four strategic phases. Each phase targets a specific customer segment with tailored messaging, channels, and conversion strategies.

**Four-Phase Approach:**
1. **Phase 1 (Months 0-6):** Bitcoin/Nostr Community - 1,000 users
2. **Phase 2 (Months 3-12):** Charity Partnerships - 5,000 users
3. **Phase 3 (Months 6-18):** Running Clubs & Organizers - 10,000 users
4. **Phase 4 (Months 12-24):** Privacy-Conscious Athletes - 50,000 users

---

## Phase 1: Bitcoin/Nostr Community (Months 0-6)

### Target: 1,000 Users | 150 Paid Subscribers | $7,350 ARR

### Why This Segment First

**Advantages:**
- Already understand Lightning payments (no education needed)
- Value privacy and decentralization (core product benefits)
- Low CAC ($0-5 organic acquisition)
- High willingness to pay for aligned products
- Evangelists who share on Nostr and Twitter

**Disadvantages:**
- Small market size (~50K total)
- May be less fitness-focused than mainstream
- Niche vocabulary (sats, nsec, relays) could limit mainstream appeal

**Decision:** Accept limited TAM to validate product-market fit before scaling.

   Subject: Podcast Guest: Building the First Nostr-Native Fitness App

   Hey [Host Name],

   I'm Dakota, founder of RUNSTR—the first fitness app built entirely on Nostr and Bitcoin.

   We're solving a problem your audience cares about: surveillance capitalism in fitness apps.
   Strava mines workout data. Garmin locks you into devices. Nike Run Club tracks everything.

   RUNSTR gives users:
   - Privacy by default (local-first storage, no email)
   - Lightning payments for competitions
   - Zero platform fees (vs Eventbrite's 10-15%)
   - Complete data ownership via Nostr protocol

   I'd love to join your show to discuss:
   - How we built a real-world Nostr use case
   - Why fitness apps are the next frontier for Bitcoin
   - The economics of zero-fee event platforms

   We just launched and have 500 users in our first week. Happy to share early metrics.

   Available any week in [Month]. 30-60 min interview works great.

   Thanks for considering!
   Dakota

#### Tactic 5: Community-Driven Content

**Objective:** Generate organic sharing through user-generated content

**Content Flywheel:**
1. User completes workout → RUNSTR generates beautiful social card
2. User shares card on Nostr / Twitter / Instagram (with RUNSTR watermark)

4. Repeat

**Tactics to Encourage Sharing:**

**1. Make Cards Share-Worthy:**
- Instagram-quality graphics (gradients, bold typography)
- Motivational quotes ("You're stronger than you think")
- Achievement badges (PRs, distance milestones, calorie burns)
- RUNSTR branding subtle but recognizable

**2. Default Share Prompts:**
- After posting workout to Nostr: "Share to Twitter?"
- One-tap cross-posting to Twitter/Instagram
- Pre-filled caption: "Just crushed a 5K in 24:30 using @RUNSTRapp 🏃⚡️ #Bitcoin #Nostr #Fitness"

**3. Social Proof:**
- Homepage: "10,000 workouts shared this month"
- Leaderboard: "Top sharers" (gamify social sharing)
- Weekly spotlight: Feature user's best workout card

**4. User Testimonial Campaign:**
- Email power users: "Can we feature your RUNSTR story?"
- Create 1-min video testimonials
- Share on Nostr with user's npub (get permission)

**Success Metrics:**
- 40% of workouts generate social cards
- 20% of social cards get shared beyond Nostr
- 100 "where did you get that card?" organic mentions

**Budget:** $0 (organic social sharing)

Subject: Save $1,000 on Your Next Virtual Race

Hi [Organizer Name],

I saw you organize [Club Name]'s runs on Meetup. Quick question: have you ever hosted a virtual race?

If you've used Eventbrite or RaceRoster, you've probably paid 10-15% in platform fees. On a $5,000 race, that's $750 going to middlemen instead of your club.

I built RUNSTR to fix this. It's a free event management platform with:
✅ Zero platform fees (vs 10-15%)
✅ Lightning fast payments (Bitcoin via Lightning Network)
✅ Built-in leaderboards (no manual Excel spreadsheets)
✅ QR code registration (digital + printable)

We've already helped 50 clubs host 200+ events and save over $50,000 in fees.

I'd love to help [Club Name] host your next race for free.

Can I send you a 5-min demo video?

Best,
Dakota
RUNSTR: runstr.app
```

**Follow-Up Sequence:**
- Day 3: Send demo video if no response
- Day 7: Case study: "How Brooklyn Runners saved $1,200"

**Success Metrics:**
- 500 emails sent
- 25% open rate (125 opens)
- 10% response rate (50 responses)
- 10 clubs sign up (20% conversion)

**Budget:** $1,000
- Email tool (Lemlist, Mailshake): $50/month × 6 months
- CRM (HubSpot, Pipedrive): $400/year

## Conclusion

This GTM strategy provides a clear path from 0 to 50,000 users over 24 months:

- **Phase 1 (0-6 mo):** Validate with Bitcoin community (low CAC, high engagement)
- **Phase 2 (3-12 mo):** Scale through charity partnerships (mission-driven virality)
- **Phase 3 (6-18 mo):** Expand to running clubs (B2B, cost-saving value prop)
- **Phase 4 (12-24 mo):** Mainstream via privacy-conscious athletes (paid ads, SEO)

**Key Principles:**
1. Start with believers (Bitcoin community), expand to mainstream
2. Leverage partnerships (charities, clubs) for low-CAC growth
3. Demonstrate value (cost savings, privacy) with content marketing
4. Scale via paid ads once organic channels prove product-market fit

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute Phase 1 tactics (Nostr launch, podcasts, conferences)
2. Track metrics weekly (signups, conversion, churn)
3. Iterate based on what works (double down on best channels)
4. Prepare Phase 2 charity partnerships (start outreach at Month 3)

The future of fitness is decentralized, privacy-first, and community-driven. Let's bring 50,000 users along for the ride.

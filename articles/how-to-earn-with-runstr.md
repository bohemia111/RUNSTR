# How to Earn Bitcoin with RUNSTR: The Complete Guide

RUNSTR turns your daily workouts into real Bitcoin earnings. This guide covers every way to earn sats in the app - from guaranteed daily rewards to competitive prize pools.

---

## 1. Daily Workout Rewards

**The simplest way to earn: complete a workout, get 50 sats.**

### How It Works

Every workout you complete in the app earns you **50 satoshis**, deposited directly to your Lightning wallet. This is automatic - just work out and get paid.

### What Triggers a Reward

Any workout completed through one of these methods:

- **GPS-tracked workouts** - Running, walking, or cycling tracked in the app
- **Manual entry** - Workouts you log manually
- **Daily steps** - Step tracking counts too

**Does NOT trigger rewards:**
- Imported HealthKit workouts (iOS)
- Imported Health Connect workouts (Android)
- Synced Nostr workouts from other apps

The key distinction: **you must complete the workout in RUNSTR** to earn rewards. Importing workouts from other apps doesn't count.

### One Reward Per Day

You earn **one reward per day**, regardless of how many workouts you complete. Eligibility resets at midnight. This encourages daily consistency.

### Setting Up Your Lightning Address

To receive rewards, configure a Lightning address in your profile:

1. Go to **Profile** → **Settings**
2. Enter your Lightning address (e.g., `yourname@getalby.com`)
3. Works with any Lightning wallet: Alby, Cash App, Strike, Phoenix, self-custodial

Once configured, rewards are sent automatically after each qualifying workout.

## 2. Leaderboard Visibility & Zaps

**Get recognized for your performance and receive tips from the community.**

### How You Appear on Leaderboards

When you complete runs at standard distances, you appear on the global Daily Leaderboard. Your entry shows:

- Your **name and profile picture**
- Your **rank** in the category
- Your **time** for that distance
- A **lightning bolt button** for receiving zaps

### Distance Categories

| Category | Minimum Distance |
|----------|------------------|
| **5K** | 5+ kilometers |
| **10K** | 10+ kilometers |
| **Half Marathon** | 21+ kilometers |
| **Marathon** | 42+ kilometers |

Your fastest time at each distance qualifies you for that category's leaderboard.

### Receiving Zaps

Anyone viewing the leaderboard can send you Bitcoin tips:

**Tap Zap (External Wallet)**
When someone taps your lightning button:
1. They see amount presets: **1,000 / 2,100 / 5,000 / 10,000 sats**
2. They can enter a custom amount
3. A Lightning invoice is generated from your address
4. They pay with any Lightning wallet (Cash App, Strike, Alby, etc.)
5. You receive the sats instantly

**Quick Zap (NWC Users)**
Users with Nostr Wallet Connect can long-press (400ms) to send an instant **21 sat** zap directly from their connected wallet - no invoice scanning required.

### Requirements to Receive Zaps

You must have a Lightning address in your Nostr profile. Set this in your profile settings. Without it, others cannot zap you.

## 3. RUNSTR Season II

**A two-month charity competition with 1,000,000 sats in prizes.**

### Overview

Season II runs from **January 1 - March 1, 2026**. Entry costs **24,000 sats** and enters you into a **500,000 sat lottery** while also letting you compete to earn money for your chosen charity.

### How to Join

1. Pay the **24,000 sat** entry fee via Lightning
2. Once paid, you're registered as a participant
3. Start logging workouts and tagging your chosen charity

### Two Ways to Win

**The Bonus Lottery (500,000 sats)**
- One random participant wins the entire 500k pool
- Every participant has an equal chance
- No performance requirement - just participate
- Winner selected randomly when season ends

**Charity Competition (500,000 sats)**
- Prize pool split across three activity categories:
  - **Running**: ~166,667 sats to the top charity
  - **Walking**: ~166,667 sats to the top charity
  - **Cycling**: ~166,667 sats to the top charity
- Your kilometers contribute to your selected charity's total
- The charity with the most combined distance from all supporters wins their category

### Tagging a Charity

When you log a workout, select one of these Bitcoin-focused charities:

- Bitcoin Beach
- Bitcoin Bay
- Bitcoin Ekasi
- Bitcoin Isla
- Bitcoin Valley
- Bitcoin District
- Bitcoin Yucatan
- Bitcoin Veterans

If you don't select a charity, your kilometers default to **OpenSats**.

### Your Role

You're competing to help your charity win - not for individual prizes. The more you run/walk/cycle, the better your charity's chances of winning their category's ~166k sats.

## 4. Custom Events with Prize Pools

**Join community-created competitions for Bitcoin prizes.**

### How Custom Events Work

Anyone can create a virtual fitness competition with a Bitcoin prize pool. Events have configurable rules:

| Setting | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Activity** | Running, Walking, Cycling |
| **Scoring** | Speed (fastest time), Distance (most km), Complete (participation) |
| **Duration** | 1 Day, 1 Week, 1 Month |
| **Prize Pool** | Set by creator (in sats) |

### Payout Schemes

How prize pools are distributed:

| Scheme | Distribution |
|--------|-------------|
| **Top 1** | 1st place: 100% |
| **Top 3** | 1st: 60%, 2nd: 25%, 3rd: 15% |
| **Top 5** | 1st: 40%, 2nd: 25%, 3rd: 17%, 4th: 11%, 5th: 7% |
| **Fixed Amount** | Equal sats per finisher (for participation events) |

### Joining Events: The Commitment System

Instead of paying sats upfront, you **commit your daily workout rewards** to join events:

| Commitment | What You're Committing |
|------------|------------------------|
| **1 Day** | Your next 1 daily reward (50 sats) |
| **3 Days** | Your next 3 daily rewards (150 sats) |
| **5 Days** | Your next 5 daily rewards (250 sats) |
| **7 Days** | Your next 7 daily rewards (350 sats) |

**How it works:**

1. Tap **"Commit X Days & Join"** on the event
2. You're immediately registered as a participant
3. Your next X daily workout rewards are redirected (not to your wallet)
4. You see **"Daily Reward Committed"** notifications showing your progress (e.g., "3/5 days")
5. After completing your commitment, rewards return to your wallet

**Important:** You can only have **one active commitment** at a time. Complete your current commitment before joining another event.

### Commitment vs. Event Duration

**These are completely independent.** The event creator sets both separately:

- A **7-day event** might only require a **1-day commitment** to enter
- A **1-day event** could require a **7-day commitment** to enter
- Any combination is possible

The commitment is your **entry cost**. The duration is **how long the competition runs**.

### Where Do Committed Rewards Go?

Event creators choose the destination when creating the event:

**To the Event Creator (Captain)**
- Your committed rewards go to the creator's Lightning wallet
- Common for competitive events where the creator funds the prize pool

**To a Charity**
- Your committed rewards go to a designated charity
- Event creator selects the charity when creating the event
- Combines competition with charitable giving

You can see the destination before joining any event.

## 5. Creating Events (For Event Creators)

### Event Creation Options

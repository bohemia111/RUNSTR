# Introducing RUNSTR

**The fitness app built for Bitcoiners. Track workouts, compete globally, earn sats.**

## What is RUNSTR?

RUNSTR is a Bitcoin-powered fitness tracking app that puts you in control. Think of it as the Strava or Nike Run Club alternative for people who care about privacy, own their data, and want to earn Bitcoin while staying active.

No email. No phone number. No credit card. No central database storing your personal information. Just you, your workouts, and Bitcoin rewards.

## The Problem with Fitness Apps

Traditional fitness apps collect everything:
- Your email and phone number
- Your location history (every run, every route)
- Your health metrics
- Your social connections
- Payment information

They store this in centralized databases, sell it to advertisers, and lock you into their ecosystem. Your years of workout data? Gone if you switch apps or they shut down.

## How RUNSTR is Different

### No Accounts, No Tracking

RUNSTR uses Nostr for identity - an open protocol where you control your own keys. Creating an account means generating a cryptographic keypair. That's it.

- **No email required**
- **No phone number required**
- **No credit card required**
- **No user accounts on our servers**
- **No central database storing your data**

Your workouts stay on your phone unless you choose to publish them. When you do publish, they go to the Nostr network - a decentralized protocol where data is portable and you're never locked in.

### Bitcoin-Native Payments

Everything financial in RUNSTR uses Bitcoin's Lightning Network:

- **Earn 50 sats daily** just for completing workouts
- **Get zapped** on leaderboards when others appreciate your performance
- **Pay entry fees** for events with any Lightning wallet
- **Win prizes** from community competitions

No payment processors taking cuts. No bank accounts required. Instant, global, permissionless transactions.

### Your Data, Your Choice

Workouts are stored locally on your device. You decide what to share:

- Keep workouts private? They stay on your phone.
- Want to compete in an event? Publish to Nostr.
- Want to share achievements socially? Post beautiful workout cards to your timeline.

The choice is always yours.

## Support Bitcoin Circular Economies

RUNSTR isn't just about fitness - it's about growing Bitcoin adoption worldwide.

Every user can select a Bitcoin circular economy charity to support. Set a donation percentage (10%, 25%, or 50%) and that portion of your daily rewards automatically goes to verified charities building Bitcoin communities around the world.

Eight circular economy projects are built in, including Bitcoin Beach (El Salvador), Bitcoin Ekasi (South Africa), and Bitcoin District (Washington DC). Your workouts can directly fund Bitcoin adoption in communities that need it most.

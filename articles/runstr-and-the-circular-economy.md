# RUNSTR and the Circular Economy

**Every workout can support Bitcoin adoption worldwide.**

## What is a Bitcoin Circular Economy?

A Bitcoin circular economy is a community where people earn, spend, and save in Bitcoin. Instead of just holding BTC as an investment, these communities use it as actual money - paying for groceries, haircuts, rent, and daily life.

The most famous example is **Bitcoin Beach** in El Zonte, El Salvador, where a donation of Bitcoin sparked a movement that eventually led to Bitcoin becoming legal tender nationwide. But Bitcoin Beach isn't alone. Similar projects are emerging across the globe:

- **Bitcoin Ekasi** in South Africa
- **Bitcoin Isla** in Mexico
- **Bitcoin Valley** in Canada
- **Bitcoin District** in Washington DC
- And more every year

These grassroots communities are proving that Bitcoin works as money - not just for the wealthy, but for everyone.

## How RUNSTR Supports Circular Economies

RUNSTR integrates Bitcoin circular economy support directly into the app. Every user can contribute to these communities through their daily workouts.

### 1. Automatic Donation Splitting

When you complete a workout and earn your daily 50 sat reward, you can choose to share a portion with a Bitcoin circular economy charity.

**How it works:**
1. Select a charity in the Rewards settings
2. Choose your donation percentage: **10%**, **25%**, or **50%**
3. Complete your daily workout
4. Your reward is automatically split

**Example**: Set 25% donation to Bitcoin Beach. Complete a workout. You receive 37 sats, and 12 sats go directly to Bitcoin Beach's Lightning address - automatically, every day.

The charities receive payments via Lightning, meaning funds arrive instantly with near-zero fees. No payment processors. No administrative overhead. Just direct support.

### 2. Verified Geyser.fund Charities

RUNSTR partners with **Geyser.fund** - a Bitcoin-native crowdfunding platform - to verify circular economy projects. Every charity in the app has:

- A verified Lightning address
- An active Geyser.fund project page
- A track record of Bitcoin education and adoption work

**Currently supported charities:**

| Charity | Location | Focus |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Bitcoin Beach** | El Salvador | The original Bitcoin circular economy |
| **Bitcoin Bay** | San Francisco | Bay Area Bitcoin community |
| **Bitcoin Ekasi** | South Africa | Township Bitcoin education |
| **Bitcoin Isla** | Isla Mujeres, Mexico | Caribbean Bitcoin adoption |
| **Bitcoin Valley** | Comox Valley, Canada | Canadian circular economy |
| **Bitcoin District** | Washington DC | US capital Bitcoin community |
| **Bitcoin Yucatan** | Yucatan, Mexico | Mexican Bitcoin education |
| **Bitcoin Veterans** | USA | Supporting veterans through Bitcoin |

When you donate through RUNSTR, funds go directly to these projects' Lightning addresses. We don't touch the money - it flows peer-to-peer.

### 3. Charity Competition in Workouts

Beyond donations, RUNSTR embeds charity support directly into workout data.

When you log a workout, you can tag it with your chosen charity. This creates a permanent, verifiable record on Nostr linking your fitness activity to the community you support.

This powers features like **RUNSTR Season II**, where charities compete based on total distance logged by their supporters.

## RUNSTR Season II: Racing for Charity

Season II is a two-month competition (January 1 - March 1, 2026) where participants race to earn money for their chosen charity.

### How It Works

**Entry**: Pay 24,000 sats to join the season

**The Competition**: Log running, walking, or cycling workouts and tag your chosen charity. Your kilometers count toward your charity's total.

**The Prize Pool**: 1,000,000 sats total
- **500,000 sats** - Random lottery (one participant wins)
- **500,000 sats** - Charity prizes split three ways:
  - ~166,667 sats to the top **running** charity
  - ~166,667 sats to the top **walking** charity
  - ~166,667 sats to the top **cycling** charity

**The Outcome**: The charities with the most combined distance from all their supporters win their category's prize. If you run 100km for Bitcoin Beach, that's 100km toward Bitcoin Beach's total. If 50 other people also run for Bitcoin Beach, all those kilometers add up.

This creates a unique dynamic: you're not competing for yourself - you're competing for your community. The more you move, the better your charity's chances.

## User-Created Events for Charity

RUNSTR lets anyone create virtual fitness events. Event creators can configure where entry fees go:

**Option 1: To the Creator**
Entry fees go to the event creator's Lightning wallet. They can use this to fund prize pools or as revenue.

**Option 2: To a Charity**
Entry fees go directly to a selected circular economy charity.

This means anyone can create a "race for charity" - a virtual 5K where all entry fees support Bitcoin Beach, or a month-long distance challenge benefiting Bitcoin Ekasi.

**How entry works:**
- Participants commit 1-7 days of their daily workout rewards to join
- Each day they complete a workout, 50 sats goes to the designated charity
- The event creator sets the rules, the charity receives the funds

No platform fees. No middlemen. Direct peer-to-peer support for Bitcoin adoption.

## The Vision: In-Person Events at Circular Economy Locations

RUNSTR is building toward something bigger than an app.

### The RUNSTR League

Starting in 2026, we're launching a global race series connecting virtual and in-person competition. The League will host events at Bitcoin circular economy locations worldwide.

**First Event: Washington DC - March 15th, 2026**

Our inaugural in-person event will be held in partnership with Bitcoin District. This is the beginning of a series that will eventually include:

- Runs through El Zonte (Bitcoin Beach)
- Races in Isla Mujeres (Bitcoin Isla)
- Events in South African townships (Bitcoin Ekasi)
- And more as the network grows

### Why In-Person?

Virtual events are great for global participation. But there's something powerful about physically running through a community where Bitcoin is money.

Imagine a 5K through El Zonte where you can:
- Pay for your post-race meal in sats
- Buy local goods with Lightning
- Meet the people building the circular economy
- See firsthand how Bitcoin changes lives

The RUNSTR League connects fitness enthusiasts directly to these communities. Run the race. Stay for the culture. Spend your sats locally.

## The Bigger Picture

Bitcoin's success depends on it being used as money, not just held as savings. Circular economies prove the use case every single day.

RUNSTR creates a bridge between two communities that naturally overlap: people who care about health and people who care about Bitcoin. Both groups value self-improvement, discipline, and building for the future.

By connecting fitness to circular economy funding, we're:
- Creating sustainable revenue streams for Bitcoin adoption projects
- Giving Bitcoiners a meaningful way to contribute beyond buying and holding
- Building a global community around health and sound money

One workout at a time. One sat at a time. One circular economy at a time.

*All donations go directly to charity Lightning addresses via peer-to-peer payments. RUNSTR never holds or processes charitable funds. Track your total contributions in the Rewards section of the app.*

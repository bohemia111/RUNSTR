# Chapter 17: RUNSTR In Meatspace

## Summary

RUNSTR's in-person race events represent a strategic expansion beyond the app, creating a sustainable funding model that supports three interconnected goals: filling the rewards pool that pays users for workouts, raising money for charitable causes like the ALS Foundation, and generating revenue for ongoing app development. The key insight is that race events can be self-sustaining—sponsors cover operational costs, ticket sales fund the rewards pool and development, and the events themselves drive app adoption. Rather than relying on venture capital or token sales, RUNSTR builds a real business where fitness enthusiasts pay for valuable experiences while unknowingly participating in a Bitcoin-powered ecosystem.

## The Vision: Fitness Events as a Sustainable Business Model

RUNSTR is heading in the direction of being a Bitcoin-powered fitness company. The business model has multiple revenue streams:

1. **Subscriptions** - Season passes for access to special events and features
2. **In-person events** - Ticket sales and sponsorships
3. **Strategic reserve** - Event profits fund company reserves and rewards pool

### Company Goals

- Make a profitable fitness company that protects user privacy
- Have a sustainable rewards model
- Participate in the broader fitness ecosystem while catering to Bitcoin and Nostr users
- Hit in-person events hard
- Survive for 10 years while stacking sats and contributing to charitable causes
- Ensure employees get paid with strong incentives to help the project grow
- **Avoid grants and investors**

### The Core Product Philosophy

The app should remain very simple:

> A privacy-preserving fitness tracker that gives you Bitcoin for working out. You can donate a portion of those rewards to charity. You can also participate in virtual fitness events to help raise money for charity and earn additional rewards.

Key principles:
- Reward people for exercise
- Allow donation splits to charity
- Custom leaderboards with charity branding
- Never collect sensitive user information

## The Inaugural DC Event: March 15 at Haines Point

The first major RUNSTR race takes place **March 15, 2026**, at Haines Point in Washington DC, produced in partnership with **Bitcoin District** and **Pubkey DC**. Bitcoin District provides local Bitcoin community support, and Pubkey DC offers the perfect post-race venue.

The 5K race format keeps the barrier to entry low (most people can complete a 5K with minimal training) while still creating a legitimate competitive event. Haines Point's scenic loop along the Potomac River provides an attractive course that appeals to both casual joggers and serious runners looking for a flat, fast route.

---

## Professional Event Management Partnership

Rather than attempting to handle race logistics internally, RUNSTR has partnered with a professional 5K race event management company. This team handles the complex operational requirements:

- Obtaining permits from the National Park Service
- Setting up a registration website
- Managing ticket sales
- Coordinating race-day logistics (timing chips, finish line equipment)
- Ensuring proper safety protocols

This division of labor lets RUNSTR focus on what it does best—community building, Bitcoin/Nostr integration, and app development—while professionals handle the aspects that require specialized expertise and local relationships with municipal authorities.

## The Sponsorship Strategy: Normie Brands Meet Bitcoin Companies

The sponsorship approach targets two distinct audiences:

### Normie Sponsors
Local running stores, sports drink companies, athletic wear brands provide legitimacy and cover event costs. They receive:
- Banner placement around the race course
- Logo placement on the RUNSTR raceday shirt
- Mentions during the post-race brunch
- Exposure through YouTube broadcast and social media content

### Bitcoin Sponsors
Bitcoin-focused sponsors get an opportunity to connect with an audience outside the Bitcoin echo chamber.

A dedicated sales person is being hired to secure sponsorships for the DC event and build relationships for planned expansion to Texas, Tennessee, and Mexico later in 2026.

## The Stealth Bitcoin Approach: Don't Mention Bitcoin

The most counterintuitive aspect of RUNSTR's event strategy is what **won't** be mentioned: Bitcoin and Nostr.

Fitness enthusiasts showing up for a 5K race don't want to hear about decentralized protocols or monetary policy—they want to run, get a t-shirt, and maybe win a prize.

RUNSTR positions itself simply as:

> "A privacy-preserving Strava alternative that's free and open source, focused on private local-first fitness tracking, with the opportunity to support a charity with every workout."

The Bitcoin layer operates invisibly:
- Merchants accept Lightning payments (but also cash and cards)
- The app sends rewards in sats (but users just see numbers going up)

Users discover the Bitcoin angle organically when they're ready, not through aggressive proselytizing.

---

## Dual Distribution: Normie Channels and Nostr Networks

Ticket distribution follows the same dual-track approach as sponsorship:

### Traditional Channels (Event Management Company)
- RunSignUp
- Facebook events
- Local running club newsletters
- Flyers at gyms and running stores

### Bitcoin/Nostr Channels (RUNSTR Team)
- Tickets on **Satlantis** (Bitcoin ticketing platform)
- Event listed in **Club Orange** and other Nostr apps
- Promotion across Nostr relays and Bitcoin Twitter

This dual distribution maximizes reach: normie runners find the event through familiar channels, while Bitcoiners discover it through their preferred platforms.

**Target mix:** 80% regular runners who've never heard of Bitcoin, 20% Bitcoiners who run—creating natural opportunities for organic conversation without forced evangelism.

---

## Virtual Participation: Bringing the App Into the Event

The RUNSTR app enables virtual participation, transforming a local DC race into a global event.

Users anywhere in the world can:
1. Purchase a virtual ticket
2. Run their own 5K during the event window
3. Appear on the same leaderboard as in-person participants

The app highlights top virtual participants, who receive:
- Live shoutouts during the YouTube/Zap.stream broadcast
- Instant zaps to their Lightning addresses

This virtual layer serves multiple purposes:
- Generates additional revenue
- Expands the community beyond DC
- Creates content for social media (runners from different countries)
- Demonstrates the app's core functionality to potential new users

**Success metric:** 30+ virtual participants, additional app downloads and subscribers.

---

## The Post-Race Experience: Pubkey Brunch and Raffle

The race itself is just the beginning. After crossing the finish line, participants head to **Pubkey DC** for a post-race brunch.

### Brunch Elements
- Live music creates atmosphere
- Raffle distributes cash prizes (dollars or Bitcoin, winner's choice)
- Charity announcement moment

### The Charity Component
RUNSTR announces which charity "won" based on:
- Participants' selected charities
- Race times or distances

The charity prize pool (perhaps $500 or Bitcoin equivalent) is handed over, creating a photo opportunity for social media.

### Season Pass Announcement
This is when RUNSTR announces the Season Pass availability in the app for $20, capturing motivated runners while the experience is fresh.

---

## Content Creation and Brand Amplification

Every element of the event feeds content creation.

### Live Broadcast
- YouTube channel broadcasts live from the race
- Start-line energy, mid-race footage, finish-line celebrations, brunch highlights
- Simultaneous stream on **Zap.stream** where Nostr users can zap and interact

### Content Breakdown
Long-form content gets broken into shorts:
- 60-second race recap
- Individual finish-line celebrations
- Charity announcement moment
- Merchant spotlights
- Sponsor acknowledgments

### Sponsor Touchpoints
- Banner visibility during broadcast
- Mentions in commentary
- Dedicated sponsor-highlight shorts
- Inclusion in recap posts

This content strategy extends the event's reach far beyond the 200 in-person participants—potentially reaching thousands through algorithmic distribution on YouTube and organic sharing on Nostr.

## Scaling: The Path to 100+ Events Per Year

The DC event is a proof of concept for a larger vision.

### 2026 Target Locations
- **Texas** - Austin's tech-forward culture and established Bitcoin meetups
- **Tennessee** - Nashville's growing Bitcoin scene and Music City Marathon infrastructure
- **Mexico** - Bitcoin Beach-style circular economy projects, international expansion

### The Playbook (Repeatable)
1. Partner with local Bitcoin communities for venue and promotion
2. Hire professional event management for logistics
3. Secure both normie and Bitcoin sponsors
4. Maintain the stealth approach

### Scaling Math

**Per-Event Economics:**
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| 200 in-person @ $35 | $7,000 |
| 30 virtual @ $10 | $300 |
| 10 sponsors @ $500 min | $5,000 |
| **Revenue** | **~$12,300** |

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Event management | $3,000 |
| Vendors | $500 |
| Shirts/medals | $500 |
| Prizes/raffle | $600 |
| Buffer | $2,400 |
| **Expenses** | **~$7,000** |

**Profit per event:** ~$5,000

### Scale Scenarios

| Events/Year | Profit |
|-------------|--------|
| 4 events | $20,000 |
| 20 events | $100,000 |
| 100 events | $500,000 |
| 200 events | $1,000,000 |

**200 events = 2 events every weekend for a year**

The path to scale: bring the event management team in-house and focus exclusively on RUNSTR events.

## The Lightning Node Strategy

RUNSTR conducts rewards and donations through its own Lightning node.

### Current Architecture
- App's NWC wallet sends all rewards and charity payments
- Payment verification enabled (both transactions confirmed)
- Accurate donation tracking

### Future Vision
- Hook into **Amboss** for node metrics and liquidity management
- Contract with a Lightning liquidity management specialist
- As volume grows, earn yield from routing transactions
- Node develops strong metrics for sending/receiving activity

**Ultimate goal:** Rewards funded partially by routing fee yield, creating a self-sustaining rewards pool.

---

## Subscription Revenue Model

Beyond events, RUNSTR builds recurring revenue through subscriptions.

### Target
**150,000 users paying 10,000 sats/month**

This subscription revenue funds:
- App development
- Team salaries
- Ongoing operations

Event profits flow into the RUNSTR strategic reserve—building a sats treasury that compounds over time.

---

## Success Metrics for DC

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| In-person participants | 200 |
| Virtual participants | 30 |
| Normie sponsors | 7 |
| Bitcoin sponsors | 3 |
| App downloads | Significant |
| Season Pass signups | Meaningful |
| Charity raised | $500+ |
| Content pieces created | Library for ongoing marketing |

**Proof of concept validation:** Success in DC makes Texas/Tennessee/Mexico easier to fund and execute.

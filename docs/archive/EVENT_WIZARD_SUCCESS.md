## **Known Limitations (Pre-Enhancement)**

### **1. Social Posts**
- ❌ Text-only (no visual cards)
- ❌ Missing event time in post
- ❌ Missing recurring info in post
- ❌ Uses standard Alert.alert() (not custom styled)

### **2. Button Text**
- ⚠️ Shows "Published ✓" instead of "Finished"

### **3. Visual Design**
- ⚠️ Success alerts not using custom black/orange theme

---

## **Improvements Planned**

### **Phase 1: Visual Enhancements**
1. Replace Alert.alert() with CustomAlert (black/orange theme)
2. Change button text to "Finished"
3. Remove excessive emojis from social posts

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Social Cards**
1. Integrate EventAnnouncementCardGenerator
2. Generate beautiful SVG cards for social posts
3. Include event time and recurring info in cards
4. Embed SVG as base64 image in kind 1 events

### **Phase 3: Complete Event Info**
1. Display event start time in social posts
2. Display recurring schedule in social posts
3. Show duration in event cards (future)

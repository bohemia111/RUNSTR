# RUNSTR Pre-Launch Comprehensive Review Script

## Instructions for Claude Sonnet 4.5
This script guides you through a systematic pre-launch review of the RUNSTR app. Focus on **quick, high-impact, safe improvements** that will enhance the initial launch experience. Prioritize user-facing issues over internal refactoring.

**Updated**: January 2025 - Reflects current three-pillar architecture (Teams, Competitions, Workouts)

## Current Architecture Context (January 2025)
- **Three Core Pillars**: Teams (kind 33404 metadata, kind 30000 rosters), Competitions (kind 30100 leagues, kind 30101 events), Workouts (local HealthKit → kind 1301)
- **Global NDK**: Single shared NDK instance via `GlobalNDKService` (4 relays: Damus, Primal, nos.lol, Nostr.band)
- **NWC Payments**: Teams receive via Nostr Wallet Connect, users pay with ANY Lightning wallet (Cash App, Strike, Alby)
- **Payment Verification**: Dual-path system (NWC auto-verify + manual override for captains)
- **HealthKit Integration**: Transform Apple Health workouts into Nostr events + beautiful social cards
- **No Supabase**: Pure Nostr-only data model

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Critical Issues Audit (15 minutes)

#### 1.1 TypeScript & Build Validation
```bash
# Run these commands and report ALL errors
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```

**Task**: List every TypeScript error with file path and line number. Categorize as:
- **Critical** (prevents build): Fix immediately
- **Warning** (cosmetic): Note for post-launch
- **Type-only** (no runtime impact): Low priority

#### 1.2 Authentication & Wallet Critical Path
**Files to audit**:
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- `src/services/auth/*`
- `src/services/wallet/NWCWalletService.ts` (updated from NutzapService)
- `src/services/wallet/WalletInitializationService.ts`

**Check for**:
- ✅ Error boundaries around NWC wallet initialization
- ✅ Graceful fallback if wallet creation fails
- ✅ Clear user messaging for auth failures
- ✅ No exposed nsec/private keys in logs
- ✅ Proper AsyncStorage key cleanup on logout
- ✅ NWC connection string encryption/storage

**Output**: List any missing error handling or security issues.

#### 1.3 Nostr Connection Stability
**Files to audit**:
- `src/services/nostr/GlobalNDKService.ts`
- `src/services/cache/UnifiedNostrCache.ts`

**Check for**:
- ✅ Connection retry logic on failure
- ✅ User feedback when relays are disconnected
- ✅ Timeout handling for slow queries
- ✅ No infinite loops in reconnection logic
- ✅ Memory leak prevention (event listener cleanup)

**Output**: Identify any potential connection issues or missing user feedback.

---

### Phase 2: User Experience Quick Wins (20 minutes)

#### 2.1 Loading States Audit
**Scan all screens** in `src/screens/`:

**Check each screen for**:
- ✅ Loading spinner while fetching data
- ✅ Empty state messages (e.g., "No teams found")
- ✅ Error state with retry button
- ✅ Skeleton loaders for better perceived performance

**Output**: List screens missing loading/empty/error states with specific recommendations.

#### 2.2 Button & Interaction Feedback
**Scan all components** in `src/components/`:

**Check for**:
- ✅ Disabled state on buttons after click (prevent double-submit)
- ✅ Loading indicators on async actions
- ✅ Success/failure toast messages
- ✅ Haptic feedback on important actions (using expo-haptics)

**Output**: List components missing interaction feedback.

#### 2.3 Navigation Edge Cases
**Files to audit**:
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`
- `src/navigation/navigationHandlers.ts`

**Check for**:
- ✅ Back button behavior (no dead ends)
- ✅ Deep link handling (if applicable)
- ✅ Tab state preservation
- ✅ No navigation loops
- ✅ Proper stack reset on logout

**Output**: Identify any navigation issues or improvements.

### Phase 3: Data Integrity & Performance (15 minutes)

#### 3.1 Nostr Event Query Optimization
**Files to audit**:
- `src/services/competition/SimpleLeaderboardService.ts` (updated architecture)
- `src/services/competition/SimpleCompetitionService.ts`
- `src/services/fitness/NdkWorkoutService.ts`
- `src/services/team/NdkTeamService.ts`
- `src/services/chat/ChatService.ts`

**Check for**:
- ✅ Proper date range filters with `since`/`until` (avoid unbounded queries)
- ✅ Query limits (e.g., `limit: 100` for competitions, `limit: 500` for workouts)
- ✅ Deduplication of events (by event.id)
- ✅ Cache invalidation strategy (5min for leaderboards, 24hr for profiles)
- ✅ No redundant queries (check for duplicate fetchEvents calls)
- ✅ Use of GlobalNDKService.getInstance() instead of creating new NDK instances

**Output**: List any unbounded queries or missing optimizations.

**Known Issues** (from 2025-10-14 audit):
- 20+ unbounded queries identified (ChatService.ts, SimpleCompetitionService.ts, etc.)
- Verify these have been fixed with proper limits

#### 3.2 Memory Leak Prevention
**Scan for**:
```typescript
// Search pattern: useEffect with subscriptions
grep -r "useEffect" src/screens/ src/components/
```

**Check each useEffect for**:
- ✅ Cleanup function that unsubscribes
- ✅ Event listener removal
- ✅ Timer/interval cleanup
- ✅ Proper dependency arrays

**Output**: List any useEffect hooks missing cleanup functions.

**Known Critical Issues** (from 2025-10-14 audit):
Must verify these 4 files have cleanup functions:
- `src/components/profile/tabs/PublicWorkoutsTab.tsx:53`
- `src/components/team/JoinRequestsSection.tsx:56`
- `src/components/ui/NostrConnectionStatus.tsx:32`
- `src/screens/ProfileImportScreen.tsx:47`

- No hardcoded colors in components
- Consistent spacing (no arbitrary margins)
- Button styles match design system

**Scan**: `src/components/` and `src/screens/` for inline styles

**Output**: List components with hardcoded colors or inconsistent styling.

#### 4.2 Text & Messaging
**Check all user-facing text for**:
- ✅ No Lorem Ipsum or placeholder text
- ✅ Clear error messages (no technical jargon)
- ✅ Consistent capitalization (Button Labels vs Sentence case)
- ✅ No typos in critical paths

**Output**: List any placeholder text or confusing messages.

#### 4.3 Accessibility Quick Wins
**Check for**:
- ✅ Touchable components have minimum 44x44pt hit area
- ✅ Important buttons have `accessibilityLabel`
- ✅ Text contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- ✅ No text in images (use accessible components)

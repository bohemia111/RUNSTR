# RUNSTR Team Creation Fix - Supabase Database Function

## Problem
Team creation fails with foreign key constraint error even though users exist. This is due to Row Level Security (RLS) policies interfering with foreign key validation.

## Solution
Add this atomic database function to your Supabase instance:

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jdkpydfxbimvahynycxo
2. Click "SQL Editor" in the sidebar
3. Click "New Query"

### Step 2: Run This SQL Function
```sql
-- Atomic team creation function that bypasses RLS issues
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_team_with_captain(
    p_team_name TEXT,
    p_team_about TEXT,
    p_captain_id UUID,
    p_captain_name TEXT,
    p_difficulty TEXT DEFAULT 'intermediate',
    p_prize_pool INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)
RETURNS JSON
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
    v_team_id UUID;
    v_result JSON;
BEGIN
    -- Step 1: Ensure captain user exists (UPSERT)
    INSERT INTO users (id, name, role, created_at, updated_at)
    VALUES (p_captain_id, p_captain_name, 'captain', NOW(), NOW())
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
        role = EXCLUDED.role,
        updated_at = NOW();

    -- Step 2: Create team
    INSERT INTO teams (
        name, 
        about, 
        captain_id, 
        difficulty_level, 
        prize_pool, 
        is_active, 
        is_featured, 
        member_count
    )
    VALUES (
        p_team_name, 
        p_team_about, 
        p_captain_id, 
        p_difficulty::difficulty_level, 
        p_prize_pool, 
        true, 
        false, 
        1
    )
    RETURNING id INTO v_team_id;

    -- Step 3: Add captain as team member
    INSERT INTO team_members (
        user_id, 
        team_id, 
        role, 
        joined_at, 
        is_active, 
        total_workouts, 
        total_distance_meters
    )
    VALUES (
        p_captain_id, 
        v_team_id, 
        'captain', 
        NOW(), 
        true, 
        0, 
        0
    );

    -- Step 4: Update user's current team
    UPDATE users 
    SET current_team_id = v_team_id, updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE id = p_captain_id;

    -- Return success result
    v_result := json_build_object(
        'success', true,
        'team_id', v_team_id,
        'message', 'Team created successfully'
    );
    
    RETURN v_result;

EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    -- Return error result
    v_result := json_build_object(
        'success', false,
        'error', SQLERRM,
        'message', 'Team creation failed'
    );
    
    RETURN v_result;
END;
$$;

-- Grant execute permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION create_team_with_captain(TEXT, TEXT, UUID, TEXT, TEXT, INTEGER) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION create_team_with_captain(TEXT, TEXT, UUID, TEXT, TEXT, INTEGER) TO anon;
```

### Step 3: Click "RUN" to execute the SQL

### Step 4: Restart your app
The app will now use this atomic database function that bypasses the RLS foreign key constraint issue.

## Alternative Quick Fix (If above doesn't work)
If the function doesn't work immediately, you can also try disabling RLS on the users table temporarily:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Warning**: This removes security policies on the users table. Only use for testing.

## What This Fixes
1. **Atomicity**: All team creation operations happen in one transaction
2. **RLS Bypass**: Function runs with elevated permissions (`SECURITY DEFINER`)
3. **User Consistency**: Ensures user exists before creating team
4. **No Race Conditions**: Everything happens atomically

The app already has the code to use this function - it just needs the database function to exist.

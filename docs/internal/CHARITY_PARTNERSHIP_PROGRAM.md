## Why Partner with RUNSTR

### The Problem with Traditional Platforms

**Eventbrite (Race Registration):**
- Platform fee: 3.5% + $1.59 per ticket
- Payment processing: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **Total extraction: 10-15% of every dollar raised**
- Example: $10,000 raised → $1,500 lost to fees

**GoFundMe (Fundraising):**
- Platform fee: 0% (but aggressive "tips" prompts)
- Payment processing: 2.9% + $0.30
- **Total extraction: ~3-5% of donations**
- Example: $10,000 raised → $500 lost to fees

**RUNSTR (Zero Fees):**
- Platform fee: **$0.00**
- Lightning Network routing: **~0.1%**
- **Total extraction: <$10 on $10,000 raised**
- Example: $10,000 raised → **$9,990 to charity**

**Savings: $1,490 per $10K raised vs traditional platforms**

---

### Why Virtual Fitness Fundraising Works

**Donor Psychology:**
- People donate more when they **participate** vs passive giving
- Virtual races have **low barrier to entry** (no travel, run anytime)
- Fitness goals + charity = powerful combination (feel good + do good)
- Global reach (Bitcoin enables international donors without wire fees)

**Success Stories:**
- **Charity: Water** raised $2M+ via virtual races
- **St. Jude Children's Hospital** raised $500K via virtual marathons
- **American Heart Association** pivoted to virtual during COVID, raised $100M+

**RUNSTR Advantages:**
- Bitcoin donations = **instant settlement** (no 7-day payment holds)
- Lightning Network = **global accessibility** (no credit card required)
- Zero fees = **100% of entry fees go to cause**
- Built-in leaderboards = **gamification drives engagement**

## Affiliate Program (Optional)

### Earn $5 Per Premium Subscriber

**How It Works:**
1. Charity gets custom affiliate code (e.g., "OPENSATS20")
2. Charity promotes RUNSTR to donor base
3. Users sign up with code, get 20% off Premium ($39/year vs $49)
4. Charity earns $5 for every paid subscriber
5. Monthly payouts via Lightning

**Example:**
- Charity promotes to 10,000 donors
- 1% sign up (100 users)
- 15% convert to paid (15 subscribers)
- Charity earns: 15 × $5 = **$75/month = $900/year**

**Why This Works:**
- Recurring revenue for charity (passive income)
- Users get discount (value for donors)
- RUNSTR gets warm leads (lower CAC)

**Marketing Materials Provided:**
- Email template: "Support [Charity] by trying RUNSTR Premium (20% off)"
- Social posts: "[Charity] partners with RUNSTR—get 20% off with code OPENSATS20"
- Website banner: "Use RUNSTR? Get 20% off Premium and support [Charity]"

## FAQ for Charity Partners

### Do we need to know about Bitcoin to participate?

**No!** We handle all the Bitcoin complexity. You just need a Lightning address (we'll help you set one up). Think of it like getting a PayPal account—easy to set up, instant to receive donations.

---

### What if our donors don't have Bitcoin?

**They don't need Bitcoin!** Most RUNSTR users pay with:
- Cash App (mainstream app, converts dollars to Bitcoin automatically)
- Strike (similar to Venmo, Bitcoin behind the scenes)
- Alby (Nostr-integrated wallet)

It's as easy as paying with PayPal, but with near-zero fees.

---

### Can we accept fiat donations too?

**Yes!** You can run traditional fundraising simultaneously. RUNSTR is an *additional* channel, not a replacement. Many charities do:
- RUNSTR events for Bitcoin/tech community
- GoFundMe for mainstream donors
- Direct bank transfers for major donors

---

### What if we don't hit our fundraising goal?

**No problem.** There are no penalties or fees. You keep 100% of whatever is raised, even if it's below your goal. We'll work with you to understand what worked and adjust for future races.

---

### How much promotion is expected from us?

**Charity Champion tier:** 2 email blasts + 5 social posts per race (2 races/year = ~14 touchpoints)

**Charity Supporter tier:** 1 email blast + 2 social posts (1 race/year = ~3 touchpoints)

We provide all copy and graphics. Your part is sending to your audience.

---

### Can we host races for specific projects?

**Absolutely!** Many charities do:
- "Run for Education" (funds teacher salaries)
- "Miles for Water" (funds well construction)
- "Steps for Bitcoin Developers" (OpenSats model)

Specific goals resonate better than general fundraising.

---

### What happens if RUNSTR shuts down?

Your data is safe. We're built on Nostr protocol—a decentralized network. Even if RUNSTR the company ceases to exist:
- Your Lightning address still works (it's not RUNSTR-dependent)
- Your donor data lives on Nostr relays (multiple backups)
- Another app can pick up where we left off

Plus, you own the donor relationships (emails, names). You're not locked in.

---

### How is this different from GoFundMe or Facebook Fundraisers?

| Feature | RUNSTR | GoFundMe | Facebook |
|---------|--------|----------|----------|
| Platform fee | 0% | 0% (but tips) | 0% |
| Payment processing | 0.1% | 2.9% + $0.30 | 1.9% + $0.30 |
| Fitness integration | ✅ Built-in | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| Leaderboards | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Global access | ✅ Bitcoin, no banks | ⚠️ Credit cards only | ⚠️ Credit cards only |
| Instant settlement | ✅ Seconds | ❌ 7-14 days | ❌ Days |

**Bottom line:** RUNSTR is built for virtual fitness fundraising. The others are general donation platforms.

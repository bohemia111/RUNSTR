# App Store Release Notes - Version 0.9.4

## What's New in Version 0.9.4

**Improved Android Background Tracking** - Fixed battery optimization issues that were preventing workouts from tracking in the background on Android. Your runs, walks, and rides will now track reliably even when the screen is off.

**Enhanced Cycling Tracker** - Redesigned the cycling tracker interface with a cleaner 2x2 grid layout showing Distance, Duration, Speed, and Elevation all at once. Easier to read while riding!

**Countdown for Cycling Starts** - Added a 3-2-1-GO countdown when starting cycling workouts, giving you time to mount your bike and get ready before GPS tracking begins.

**Cleaner First-Time Experience** - Removed confusing warning messages that appeared for new users, making the app feel more polished when you first download it.

This update focuses on stability and quality-of-life improvements to make your fitness tracking experience smoother on both iOS and Android.

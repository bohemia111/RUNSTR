# Debug Components

Debug components for diagnosing issues in RUNSTR. These are typically only enabled in debug/testing builds.

## Files

### ActivityDebugOverlay.tsx
Real-time diagnostic overlay for GPS death diagnosis during workouts. Shows:
- GPS subscription status (is expo-location reporting active?)
- Watchdog health (is the JS timer still running?)
- TaskManager heartbeat (when did background task last execute?)
- Recovery stats (success/failure counts)
- Distance tracking metrics

Used in RunningTrackerScreen when `DEBUG_MODE = true`.

## Usage

The debug overlay is controlled by the `DEBUG_MODE` constant in the tracker screens:

```typescript
// In RunningTrackerScreen.tsx
const DEBUG_MODE = true; // Set to false for production

// Renders the overlay when tracking is active
{DEBUG_MODE && isTracking && <ActivityDebugOverlay />}
```

## Debug Log Format

Users can tap "Copy Debug Log" to copy diagnostic data to clipboard for DMs:

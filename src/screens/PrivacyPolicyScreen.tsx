      title: '1. Information We Collect',
      content: `RUNSTR operates on the Nostr protocol, which means most of your data is public by design. We collect:

• Nostr Public Data: Your profile (kind 0 events), workouts (kind 1301 events), team memberships, and competition entries are all public on the Nostr network.

• Local Storage Only: Your nsec (private key) and app preferences are stored locally on your device - we never have access to these.

• HealthKit Data (iOS): With your permission, we read workout data from Apple Health. This data is only used locally and shared to Nostr when you explicitly choose to post.

• No Server Collection: RUNSTR has no backend servers collecting your data. All data lives on the decentralized Nostr network or your device.`,
    },
    {
      title: '2. How We Use Information',
      content: `Your information powers the RUNSTR experience:

• Competition Scoring: Public workout events (kind 1301) are used to calculate leaderboards and determine winners.

• Team Membership: Your npub (public key) identifies you as a team member for competition eligibility.

• Social Features: Posted workouts (kind 1) with achievement cards are shared publicly for community engagement.

• Local Preferences: Settings stored on your device customize your app experience.

• No Analytics: We don't use tracking pixels, analytics services, or collect usage statistics.`,
    },
    {
      title: '3. Data Ownership & Control',
      content: `You own your data on RUNSTR:

• Your Identity: Your identity keys are yours alone. You can use them across compatible apps.

• Data Portability: All your workouts, team memberships, and achievements can be accessed from compatible clients.

• Local Deletion: You can clear local app data anytime through device settings.

• Data Persistence: Published data cannot be deleted but can be superseded by newer entries.

• Relay Choice: You control which servers store your data through your client settings.`,
    },
    {
      title: '4. Financial Privacy',
      content: `RUNSTR handles rewards responsibly:

• Non-Custodial: We never hold your funds. All sats remain in your control via NutZap eCash.

• Lightning Privacy: Lightning Network transactions provide enhanced privacy.

• Public Prizes: Competition winnings are announced publicly for transparency.

• No Financial Data: We don't store credit cards, bank accounts, or payment methods.

• eCash Privacy: NutZap provides additional privacy through eCash tokens.`,
    },
    {
      title: '5. Data Security',
      content: `We protect your information through:

• Local Encryption: Your nsec is encrypted in device storage using platform security features.

• No Cloud Storage: Without servers, there's no central database to breach.

• TLS Connections: All relay connections use encrypted protocols.

• Open Source: Our code is auditable for security verification.

• Key Management: We encourage best practices for nsec security and never ask for your private key outside the app.`,
    },
    {
      title: '6. Third-Party Services',
      content: `RUNSTR interacts with:

• Nostr Relays: Public relays (Damus, Primal, nos.lol) store and distribute Nostr events.

• Apple HealthKit: iOS fitness data access (read-only, with your permission).

• CoinOS API: Lightning Network payments (no personal data shared).

• No Ad Networks: We don't use advertising or marketing services.

• No Analytics: We don't use Google Analytics, Firebase, or similar services.`,
    },
    {
      title: "7. Children's Privacy",
      content: `RUNSTR is designed for users 13 and older:

• Age Requirement: Users must be 13+ to use RUNSTR per Nostr community standards.

• No Child-Specific Features: We don't knowingly collect data from children under 13.

• Parental Controls: Parents should monitor their children's Nostr usage.`,
    },
    {
      title: '8. Your Rights',
      content: `You have complete control over your data:

• Access: View all your public Nostr data through any compatible client.

• Correction: Update your profile and data by publishing new Nostr events.

• Portability: Export your nsec and use it with any Nostr application.

• Local Deletion: Remove app data from your device at any time.

• Relay Selection: Choose which relays store your events.`,

      title: '9. Changes to This Policy',
      content: `We may update this privacy policy:

• Notification: Significant changes will be announced via in-app notifications.

• Version History: Each update includes a version number and date.

• User Consent: Continued use after changes indicates acceptance.

• Transparency: All changes are documented in our open-source repository.`,

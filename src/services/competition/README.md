## 🔧 Service Details

### EventEligibilityService

**Purpose**: Automatically detect eligible events for completed workouts

**Key Methods**:
- `checkWorkoutEligibility(workout, userTeams)` - Main eligibility detection
- `getSuggestedEvents(workout, userTeams)` - Get top 3 event suggestions
- `enterWorkoutInEvent(workout, event, privateKey)` - Submit workout to event
- `calculateEventEligibility(workout, event)` - Score workout-event compatibility

**Eligibility Scoring**:
- **90-100**: Perfect match (all required data present, exact activity type match)
- **70-89**: Great match (good data completeness, compatible activity type)
- **50-69**: Good match (basic data present, possible activity match)
- **0-49**: Poor match (limited data or activity mismatch)

**Activity Type Matching**:
```typescript
// Direct matches
'running' → 'Running'
'cycling' → 'Cycling'
'walking' → 'Walking', 'Running' (hiking compatibility)
'gym' → 'Strength Training'
'yoga' → 'Yoga'

// Competition type matching
'Fastest Time' → Requires duration + distance
'Longest Distance' → Requires distance data
'Most Calories' → Requires calorie data
'Best Average' → Requires duration + distance
```

**Caching Strategy**:
- 10-minute cache for eligibility results
- Cache key: `{workoutId}_{teamIds}`
- Automatic cache invalidation on team changes

### AutoEntryPrompt Component

**Purpose**: Beautiful modal UI for event suggestions with one-click entry

**Features**:
- **Event Cards**: Rich event information with eligibility badges
- **Quick Entry**: One-click workout submission to events
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators during entry process
- **Approval Handling**: Clear messaging for events requiring approval
- **Entry Fees**: Display Bitcoin entry fees when applicable

**User Experience**:
1. User completes workout
2. Auto-eligibility check runs in background
3. Modal appears showing eligible events (if any)
4. User can quick-enter or skip suggestions
5. Success/error feedback with appropriate messaging

### useAutoEventEntry Hook

**Purpose**: Integration layer between workout completion and event suggestions

**Key Features**:
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically checks eligibility when workouts complete
- **State Management**: Manages eligibility results, loading states, modal visibility
- **Team Integration**: Fetches user teams for eligibility checking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Customizable**: Options for auto-check, delay, notifications

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
const {
  suggestedEvents,
  showAutoEntryPrompt,
  checkWorkoutEligibility,
  enterWorkoutInEvent,
  hasEligibleEvents,
} = useAutoEventEntry({
  autoCheck: true,
  showPromptDelay: 1000,
  enableNotifications: true,
});
```
